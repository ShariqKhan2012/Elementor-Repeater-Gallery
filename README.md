## Elementor Repeater Galleries

An addon to add repeater-galleries (that's what I call them) to Elementor. 
There may be a better way to do this, but I could not find it. So, I created one for one of my projects.

## What do you mean by 'Repeated Galleries'?
Repeater galleries are just like the default galleries with the only difference being those get populated from a repeater field.

So, for example, assume that you have the following setup:
*  You have a custom post type *Tours* and it has a repeater-field with name *Album* , and this repeater field contains a media subfields *Picture*.
Similarly, there is another  repeater-field with name *Gallery* , and this repeater field contains a media subfields *Image*.
*  You create a Post titled **India Tour** : You have attached 2 instances of albums to it. 
* You create a Post titled **France Tour**: You have attached 3 instances of albums to it.
* You have specified the *Gallery source* to be picked from the subfield *Album > Picture* (See screenshot-1.png)

With this setup, when you use this addon, it will generate galleries dynamically.

And it will look something like screenshot-2.png
